# Mastering Pytorch
This repository is a collection of puzzle-like mini projects that aim to provide me with fluency of Pytorch. Each week provides me with a new concept and experiment to tackle.

See 'journal.md' for updates to my learning journey.

### Author's note
After I started building my image segmentation UNet, I quickly realized that to truly become proficient at Pytorch it would have to come from really diving deep into its interal functionality,  not simply following a tutorial and implementing the steps. This repo aims to bridge those gaps in my understand of Pytorch and hopefully enables me to understand the package at an industry-ready level.
