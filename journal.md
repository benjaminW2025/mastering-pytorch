# Week One

This first set of experiments/mini-puzzles had to go on hiatus for a couple weeks due to me falling behind on some coursework and getting caught up with studying for midterms. What I worked on throughout this week, though, was a lot of tensor manipulation- specifically tensor indexing tensor views, splicing, and broadcasting. The first three or so puzzles were largely solvable with some clever indexing (the challenge was to solve them without using loops), and then the fourth puzzle, creating a random triangle overlay given some input tensor dimensions, was tricky. I think what made it tricky was understanding that Pytorch can compute elementwise operations without loops, and this was the key to understanding how I could make the math calculations that would allow me to determine which points laid inside of the triangle. This specific puzzle also prompted me to learn some basic tensor visualization with matplotlib. I also experimented with einsums, which were a pretty nifty way to simplify the notation for any matrix calculations. Finally done with week one! I'll try to keep up with my schedule and commit my next week's progress by next Sunday, which will largely focus on torch.autograd.
